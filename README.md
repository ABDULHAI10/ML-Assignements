# Machine Learning Assignment: EDA and Regression Models

This repository contains my Machine Learning assignment where I have performed complete Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), cleaned the dataset, and applied regression models for predictive analysis. The project covers the full machine learning workflow, from raw data exploration to model training and evaluation.

## ✨ Key Highlights

- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Applied regression models:
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Tree Regressor
- Trained and evaluated models for prediction accuracy

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries Used

- Python (Google Colab)
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 📚 Workflow

1. Imported and explored the dataset
2. Cleaned missing or inconsistent data
3. Conducted EDA with statistical summaries and visualizations
4. Built regression models
5. Trained and tested the models
6. Evaluated performance using relevant metrics (e.g., Mean Squared Error)

## 🚀 How to Run

- Download the notebook or clone this repository
- Open the `.ipynb` file using Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook
- Run the notebook cells sequentially to view the full analysis

## 📈 Results

The project successfully demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques for regression tasks, showcasing model training, evaluation, and performance improvement through EDA and data cleaning.
